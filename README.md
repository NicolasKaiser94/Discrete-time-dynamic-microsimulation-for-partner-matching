# Discrete-time-dynamic-microsimulation-for-partner-matching
Dynamic microsimulation is a useful tool to gain knowledge
about a population, its demographic and socioeconomic
evolution over time. Basic population projections forecast population by age,
gender, region of residence. However, it is important to
analyse family structure. Namely to assess the impact of
social policies. The introduction of a family structure in the microsimulation
model involves matching individuals. Finding a partner is a fundamental demographic event
which influences a lot of other important events (birth,
marriage) in a population (Bouffard et. al, 2001). Our focus is to find a partner for a person. In this context,
we define partners as follows: persons living together in
one household. The approaches are different for discrete- or
continuous-time microsimulation. The ageing of the
population will be done in discrete-time steps, here every
year.
